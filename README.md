# Flappy Bird in Mario World
Flappy in Mario Word was created based on the Flappy Bird Game created in 2013 by the Vietnamese Dong Nguyen. As it is a game in 2d, your goal is to kill all the carnivorous plants that are going towards you by attacking him pressing the space key of the keyboard, in case one of them touch the bird the game ends.
At first the scenario was in the standard environment of the Flappy Bird, however, since its enemy was of the Mario game, it was modified the same.
As the bird is "invading" the scene from the other game so "malandra" was put on a "thug life" glasses to show his "thug life".
